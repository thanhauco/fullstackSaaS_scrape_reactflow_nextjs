This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

====================

Here’s a breakdown of what this project could look like:

1. Project Overview

ScrapeFlow is a SaaS platform designed to enable users to set up, manage, and visualize web scraping workflows. The core functionality might include:

	•	Creating workflows for web scraping tasks.
	•	Visualizing scraping workflows with a drag-and-drop interface.
	•	Storing and managing scraped data.
	•	Monitoring, scheduling, and tracking scraping jobs.

2. Tech Stack

	•	Frontend: Next.js with React and TypeScript for a responsive UI.
	•	State Management: React Query for data fetching and caching.
	•	Visualization: React Flow for creating, editing, and visualizing workflows.
	•	Backend: Prisma as an ORM with a Postgres or MySQL database.
	•	Server Side: Next.js API routes or a custom Express API if more flexibility is needed.

3. Frontend Components

	•	Workflow Builder: A drag-and-drop editor using React Flow.
	•	Task Management Dashboard: A list or card view to manage scraping tasks.
	•	Scraped Data Viewer: Tables or charts to display the results of completed scrapes.
	•	Authentication and User Management: Secure user sign-in, session management, and role-based permissions.

4. Backend Components

	•	Database Schema (using Prisma):
	•	Users, Projects, and Scraping Tasks tables to manage users and their scraping projects.
	•	Logs or Job table to track scraping status.
	•	API Routes:
	•	CRUD operations for workflows and tasks.
	•	Data fetching endpoints to retrieve scraped data.
	•	Task scheduling API that interfaces with a scraping service.
	•	Scraping Service: Integration with a scraping library (e.g., Puppeteer) or a third-party scraping service.

5. Key Libraries & Tools

	•	React Flow: To create an intuitive workflow designer.
	•	React Query: To handle data fetching and state management.
	•	Prisma: To connect and manage database operations efficiently.
	•	TypeScript: For type safety across the application.

6. Steps to Build

	•	Frontend: Set up Next.js, configure routing, and add pages for dashboard, workflows, and data viewing.
	•	Backend: Implement Prisma models and create API routes for managing scraping workflows.
	•	Integration: Connect React Flow with backend to allow saving/loading of workflows and data fetching with React Query.
	•	Testing & Deployment: Ensure tests are in place for key workflows and deploy on a cloud provider like Vercel or DigitalOcean.
